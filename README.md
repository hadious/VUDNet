# VUDNet: From Single Shot to Structure: End-to-End Network based Deflectometry for Specular Free-Form Surface Reconstruction

This project implements VUDNet, a novel deep neural network designed for the end-to-end 3D reconstruction of specular free-form surfaces using single-shot deflectometry. VUDNet innovatively combines discriminative and generative components—specifically a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and a modified U-Net—to accurately interpret orthogonal fringe patterns and generate high-fidelity 3D surface reconstructions. The network excels in both depth estimation and detail refinement, achieving superior performance in challenging environments.
